UserFrosting is based on the popular UserCake system, written in PHP.  UserFrosting improves on this system by adding a sleek, intuitive frontend interface based on HTML5 and Twitter Bootstrap.  We've also separated the backend PHP machinery that interacts with the database from the frontend code base.  The frontend and backend talk to each other via AJAX and JSON.\r\n\r\nChange Log - v0.1.7\r\n-------------------\r\n- Page scrolls back to top after AJAX submit.\r\n- \"Website url\" is automatically suffixed with \"/\" if necessary.\r\n- Fixed bad link to forgot_password.php.\r\n- Began implementing action authorization scheme.\r\n\r\n[Older changes](CHANGELOG.md)\r\n\r\nWhy UserFrosting?\r\n-----------------\r\nThis project grew out of a need for a simple user management system for my tutoring business, [Bloomington Tutors](http://bloomingtontutors.com).  I wanted something that I could develop rapidly and easily customize for the needs of my business.  Since my [prior web development experience](http://alexanderweissman.com/completed-projects/) was in pure PHP, I decided to go with the PHP-based UserCake system.  Over time I modified and expanded the codebase, turning it into the UserFrosting project. \r\n\r\nWhy not use Node/Drupal/Django/RoR/(insert favorite framework here)?\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nI chose PHP because PHP is what I know from my prior experience as a web developer. Additionally, PHP remains extremely popular and well-supported.  I chose not to use a framework because I wanted something that I could understand easily and develop rapidly from an existing PHP codebase.\r\n\r\nDeveloper Features\r\n-----------------\r\n- No need to learn a special framework!  The backend of UserFrosting is based on native PHP5, allowing for rapid development and deployment.\r\n- Clean separation of backend and frontend code.  Easily interact with the backend via AJAX calls.\r\n- Automated installation tool for initializing the database.\r\n- Frontend built with jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap.  Javascript components for typical database CRUD operations provided with this distribution!\r\n\r\nUser Features\r\n--------\r\nUserFrosting offers all of the features of UserCake, plus several new ones:\r\n\r\n- Account creation/deletion from the admin interface\r\n- Admin can disable/enable individual accounts\r\n- Admin can disable/enable new account registration\r\n- Dropdown menus for easier account modifications\r\n- Client-side data validation\r\n- Default permissions for new accounts\r\n- Table view for easily editing page permissions\r\n\r\nSecurity Features\r\n-----------------\r\nUserFrosting is designed to address the most common security issues with websites that handle sensitive user data:\r\n\r\n#### SSL/HTTPS compatibility\r\nUnsecured (\"http\") websites exchange data between the user and the server in plain text.  If the connection between the user and server is not secure, this data can be intercepted, and possibly even altered and/or rerouted.  And, even if the sensitive data itself is encrypted, the user's session on the website can be stolen and impersonated unless ALL communication between the user and server is handled over SSL (\"https\" websites).  If you walk into any coffee shop with an unsecured wireless network, and launch a simple program such as [Firesheep](http://codebutler.com/firesheep/), you will see how huge of a problem this is, and why [Google and other companies are pushing for _everyone_ to use SSL](http://www.wired.com/2014/04/https/).\r\n\r\nThis is also why there are strict standards about websites that handle sensitive user data such as credit card numbers!  We strongly encourage anyone planning to deploy a website that handles user passwords and sessions (such as ones based on UserFrosting) to purchase an SSL certificate and deploy it on their web server.  [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/794/67/how-to-activate-ssl-certificate) offers basic, inexpensive certs for $9/year (you do not need to have Namecheap hosting or domain registration to use their certificates on your site).  If your web hosting happens to use cPanel, this is easy to [set up yourself](http://docs.cpanel.net/twiki/bin/view/AllDocumentation/WHMDocs/InstallCert) without needing to contact your hosting provider.  Please note that SSL on shared hosting accounts may create false security warnings for end-users with [older browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication#No_support).\r\n\r\nFor __local testing purposes only__ you may create a self-signed certificate.  For instructions on how to do this for XAMPP/Apache in OSX, see [this blog post](http://shahpunyerblog.blogspot.com/2007/10/create-self-signed-ssl-certificate-in.html).\r\n\r\n#### Strong password hashing\r\nUserFrosting uses the `password_hash` and `password_verify` functions to hash and validate passwords (new in PHP v5.5.0).  `password_hash` uses the [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) algorithm, based on the Blowfish cipher.  This is stronger than SHA1 (used by UserCake), which has been demonstrated vulnerable to attack.  UserFrosting also appends a 22-character salt to user passwords, protecting against dictionary attacks.\r\n\r\nUserFrosting provides backwards compatibility for existing UserCake user databases that have passwords hashed with MD5.  User accounts that have been hashed with MD5 will automatically be updated to the new encryption standard when the user successfully logs in.\r\n\r\n#### Protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF)\r\nCSRF is an attack that relies on a user unwittingly submitting malicious data from another source while logged in to their account.  The malicious data can be embedded in an image, link, or other javascript content, on another website or in an email.  Because the user has a valid session with a website, the external content is accepted and processed.  Thus, attackers can easily change passwords or delete a user's account with this attack.\r\n\r\nTo guard against this, UserFrosting provides the `csrf_token` function (courtesy of @r3wt).  By generating a new, random CSRF token for users when they log in, inserting it into legitimate forms as a hidden field, and then having the backend form processing links check for this token before taking any action, CSRF attacks can be thwarted.\r\n\r\n#### Protection against cross-site scripting (XSS)\r\nXSS is another variety of attack that tricks a user, but instead of tricking the user into submitting malicious data (CSRF), it tricks the user into running malicious scripts.  This vulnerability usually appears when you allow arbitrary content (including javascript and HTML tags) to be processed and then regurgitated back to other users.  Thus, an attacker on a forum could create a new \"post\" that contains javascript commands.  When anyone else on the site goes to view that post, the javascript commands are executed.  Those commands could easily be instructions to transmit the user's session data to a remote server, where attackers can use it to impersonate the user.\r\n\r\nUserFrosting guards against this by sanitizing user input before storing or otherwise acting upon it.  Please let us know if you find a place where input is not properly sanitized.\r\n\r\n#### Protection against SQL injection\r\nWhereas XSS tricks the _user_ into executing malicious code, SQL injection tricks the _server_ into executing malicious code; in this case, SQL statements.  Thus, sites vulnerable to SQL injection can end up executing code that, for example, deletes a table or database.\r\n\r\nUserFrosting protects against this by using parameterized queries, which do not allow user-supplied data to be executed as code.  However there are always exceptions, and we would be glad to have some contributors test and/or help patch any possible remaining SQL injection vulnerabilities.\r\n        \r\nScreenshots\r\n-----------------\r\n#### Login page\r\n![Login page](/screenshots/login.png \"Login page\")\r\n#### Admin dashboard (thanks to [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com))\r\n![Admin dashboard](/screenshots/dashboard.png \"Admin dashboard\")\r\n#### User list page\r\n![User list](/screenshots/users.png \"User list page\")\r\n#### Create user dialog\r\n![Create user](/screenshots/create_user.png \"Create user dialog\")\r\n#### User details\r\n![User details](/screenshots/user_details.png \"User details page\")\r\n#### Site settings\r\n![Site settings](/screenshots/site_settings.png \"Site settings page\")\r\n#### Page management\r\n![Site pages](/screenshots/site_pages.png \"Page management\")\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n--------------\r\nTo install, follow these instructions:\r\n\r\n1. Create a database on your server / web hosting package. UserFrosting supports MySQLi and requires MySQL server version 4.1.3 or newer, as well as PHP 5.4 or later with PDO database connections enabled.\r\n2. Open up models/db-settings.php and fill out the connection details for your database.\r\n3. Run the UserFrosting installer at install/install.php. UserFrosting will attempt to build the database for you.\r\n4. After the installer successfully completes, delete the install folder.\r\n5. Register your admin account, which will by default be the first account that is registered.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n### Backend pages\r\nThese are pages which accept a POST or GET request, perform some action, and then return a response in the form of a JSON object.

Deploy CSRF tokens on all forms and add \"bulletproof sessions\" as per http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/how-to-create-bulletproof-sessions.\r\n2. Add **OAuth** support, for users to create accounts and log in via Facebook/Google.\r\n3. Associate permission groups with allowed actions, rather than individual pages.  Actions, in turn, are linked to pages (on the backend) and features (on the frontend).  Automatically hide features for which a user does not have permission.\r\n4. Convert to standard REST architecture, implementing updates as PUT and deletes as DELETE.  This could mean that different backend pages that act on the same type of object (users, pages, etc) could be combined into a single page that takes different actions depending on the request method.\r\n5. Add ability for admins to modify permission group names/settings.\r\n6. Filter user list by name, group membership, etc.\r\n7. Full directory/subdirectory management tool for pages.\r\n8. Add ability for admins to add/remove user account fields, without having to modify code.\r\n9. Deploy the `jqueryvalidator` plugin for client-side validation (as opposed to our own, clunkier validator).\r\n10. Admin-side user account creation should bypass activation process.\r\n11. Continue improving error-handling and rendering system.\r\n12. Finish documenting all functions and pages.\r\n\r\nPossible additional features as suggested on UserCake forums:\r\n\r\n1. \"Remember me\" feature\r\n2. Admin control over session timeout\r\n3. Auto-redirect to last visited page on login\r\n4. Admin can allow users to log in via email address instead of username\r\n\r\nCreds\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe back end account management system is derived from [UserCake 2.0.2](http://usercake.com), while the dashboard and admin account features are based on the SB Admin Template by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com).
